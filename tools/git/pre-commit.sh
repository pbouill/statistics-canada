# This pre-commit hook runs a series of quality checks:
# 1. Ruff: Lints and auto-fixes Python code.
# 2. Mypy: Performs static type checking.
# 3. pip-audit: Checks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
# 4. Bandit: Scans for common security issues in the code.
#
# If any of these checks fail, the commit will be aborted.
