# Branch Protection and Workflow Setup

## Current Workflow Status: ✅ READY

Your GitHub Actions workflows are **perfectly configured** for the requested workflow:

- All PRs must target `dev` branch
- Automatic changelog updates on merge to `dev`
- Only `dev` → `main` merges trigger PyPI releases
- Strong branch protection with helpful guidance

## Required GitHub Repository Settings

To complete the setup, configure these branch protection rules:

### Main Branch Protection

**Settings** → **Branches** → **Add rule** → **Branch: `main`**

Required settings:
- Require pull request reviews (1 approval)
- Require status checks: "Main Branch Protection"  
- Require conversation resolution
- Restrict force pushes

### Dev Branch Protection  

**Settings** → **Branches** → **Add rule** → **Branch: `dev`**

Required settings:
- Require pull request reviews (1 approval recommended)
- Require status checks: "Build and Test (Dev)"
- Require conversation resolution

### Default Branch

**Settings** → **General** → Set default branch to `dev`

## Workflow Verification

After configuring branch protection:

1. **Feature PRs to dev**: Should work normally ✅
2. **Direct pushes to main**: Should be blocked ❌  
3. **Feature PRs to main**: Blocked with helpful workflow guidance ❌
4. **Dev → main merges**: Trigger automatic PyPI release ✅

## Architecture Summary

Your workflow implements a **GitFlow-inspired** approach optimized for Python package releases:

```
feature branches → dev (with auto-changelog) → main (triggers PyPI)
```

This ensures:
- All changes are reviewed and tested
- Changelog is always up-to-date  
- Releases are controlled and automated
- Clear separation between development and production
