# Final Test: GitHub App Authentication

This is the final test to verify that the seawall-changelog-bot GitHub App authentication is working correctly.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Authentication Method**: Changed from `GITHUB_TOKEN` to `seawall-changelog-bot` GitHub App
2. **Token Generation**: Using `actions/create-github-app-token@v1` 
3. **Branch Protection**: GitHub App has permissions to bypass branch protection rules
4. **Bot Identity**: Commits will be made by `seawall-changelog-bot[bot]` instead of `github-actions[bot]`

## Expected Result

When this PR is merged to dev:
- ‚úÖ The workflow should run successfully
- ‚úÖ No branch protection violations
- ‚úÖ CHANGELOG.md should be updated directly on dev branch
- ‚úÖ Commit should be made by seawall-changelog-bot[bot]

## Previous Errors (Should Be Fixed)

- ‚ùå `GH013: Repository rule violations found for refs/heads/dev`
- ‚ùå `Changes must be made through a pull request` 
- ‚ùå `4 of 4 required status checks are expected`

Let's see if this works! ü§û
