# Test Changelog Fix

This file is created to test the fixed GitHub App authentication in the changelog workflow.

The previous test revealed that the workflow was using `GITHUB_TOKEN` instead of the seawall-changelog-bot GitHub App token.

## Fix Applied:
- Updated workflow to use `actions/create-github-app-token@v1`
- Proper token usage throughout the workflow
- Should now bypass branch protection rules correctly

**Expected Result**: After this PR is merged, the changelog workflow should succeed and update CHANGELOG.md directly on the dev branch without creating a separate PR.
